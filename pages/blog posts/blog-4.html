            <h2>Clarity & web standards</h2>

              <h3>After completing my portfolio website 4 months ago, the portfolio lacked in many categories but mainly in  2 groups; clarity (the core of usability) and web standards which are considered to be very crucial aspects of a professional and worthy website, therefore, the portfolio was in need to have major changes required to it , The changes that were carried out were:  redesigning the full portfolio and by making sure the website was meeting the web standards by focusing on eliminating all the errors by the validation process.</h3>

                </div>
               
            <h2>Clarity</h2>

            <p>When analysing and reviewing my portfolio with my peers, it stood out that the clarity of the website, required to be furthered improved. So, one of the following aspects was to make sure that my website comprised of creating a consistent experience across the entire website to keep visitors at ease. I did this by creating a structure that was consistent throughout the website, as the consistency of the previous portfolio was all over the place. For example, the content for blog post 1 and CV was aligned in the centre of the screen whereas the blog post 2 and 3 were spread out to the edges. I also made sure to have a design layout that consisted of complementary colors and a consistent menu layout.
                Also, after receiving feedback from tutors and experts from the web development industry, they mostly commented on the issue regarding certain distractions such as the fast-paced moving images (gifs). To overcome this, I removed the gifs and used static images with CSS transitions to keep animation at minimal, therefore improving the usability of the website and user experience.

            <h2>Web standards</h2>

            <p>As far as my web standards go, when validating my CSS file the result showed that there were 0 errors in total but the HTML files had more than 6 errors in each of the HTML files. Most of the errors that need changing stated to include an ‘alt’ attribute to the image element. Therefore, I made sure to include alt elements to the images that were used in the portfolio and made sure to eliminate all the errors that were displaying in the W3C Markup Validation Service. Doing this will enable my portfolio to meet the protocols of web standards and improve search engine optimization, issues of accessibility, privacy, security, and internationalization, while helping to balance speed, fairness, public accountability, and quality on the Internet.</p>

                <p>I will carry on improving the portfolio in the future, so I can personally see how far I have progressed and come to on improving my web programming skills.</p>
